# Student_Performance_Prediction
This ML project predicts a student’s final grade (G3) using factors like age, study time, failures, and attendance. Built for an IBM SkillBuild internship, it helps educators identify at-risk students early. It showcases end-to-end ML — from data preprocessing to Flask-based web deployment.
